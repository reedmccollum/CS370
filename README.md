Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

  This project is a puzzle-solving AI that used a Q-learning system to analyze each move potential and either make the best move towards the goal it knows or to make a random decision and test whether or not it is more viable than the previosly known path. The code for the pathfinding and visualization was provided, I was tasked with integrating the Q-learning system.
  
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

  Computer scientists seek to take what humans could not feasibly do themselves and make it possible, with much more efficiency. There is no cause for a computer without a       human enacting it.
  
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

  Break it till you make it. Nothing will work perfectly with every edge case included the first time. Continous trial and error is the only way a program can become better.
  
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

  Ensure that what I create is for the good of all parties. This includes not only the users and organiztions, but myself and other developers as well.
